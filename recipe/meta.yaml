  summary: 'Some utils tools for W4M'
  description: |
    Provides a set of utility function to prevent the spread of
    utilities script in W4M scripts, and centralize them in a package.
    Some are meant to be replaced by real packages in a near future, like
    the parse_args function: it is here only to prepare the ground for
    more global changes in W4M scripts and tools.
